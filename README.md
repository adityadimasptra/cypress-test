## Configuration

Cypress configuration files can be found in the `cypress` directory:

- `cypress.json`: Main configuration file.
- `cypress.env.json`: Environment-specific variables.

You can modify these files to fit your project's needs.

## Running Tests

To run the Cypress tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

To run the Cypress tests with GUI, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test:open
```

### Writing Tests
Tests are located in the cypress/integration directory. Each test file should have a .cy.js extension.

A basic test example:
```javascript
describe('My First Test', () => {
  it('Visits the Kitchen Sink', () => {
    cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')
    cy.contains('type').click()
    cy.url().should('include', '/commands/actions')
  })
})
```
